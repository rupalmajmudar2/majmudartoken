Creating and deploying a RealEstate Token on the Test network

(1) Copy the .sol file to http://remix.ethereum.org/
(2) Metamask : Move to Ropsten. Have test-ETH in 2 accounts RM and RMHello.
(3) Compile, deploy the contract in Remix
Thats it!
(4) Copy the contract address into Metamask for importing the token
    Check that it gets the initial-balance amount already!
(5) Execute the txns on the deployed contract
    e.g. (on left of solidity screen) Deployed Contracts -> transfer... : should open metamask and should work!
